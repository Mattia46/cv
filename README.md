 
## MATTIA ASSOGNA

   Junior Web Developer available immediately.
   
   After many years in the tax legislation industry as a Corporate Tax Consultant, I realised
   that it was time to follow my passion, so I attended an intensive coding programme (Makers Academy in London)
   and graduated as a full-stack developer.
   Seeking a role with a focus on TDD/BDD, continued learning and innovation.

### Code Examples
| [HouseMates](https://github.com/Mattia46/HouseMates-Web) | [TakeAway](https://github.com/Mattia46/takeaway-challenge) | [Weather](https://github.com/Mattia46/SwiftWeatherApp) |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **MEAN stack/Swift** with [@Alaan](https://github.com/Alaanzr), [@Ezzy](https://github.com/ezzye) and [@Julien](https://github.com/jbhdeconinck).  In two weeks we built our own **API** using a combination of **Node**, **Express**, **Passport** and **Mongoose** to model the data. We also integrated the **Google Maps API**. I really enjoyed working in a team (using **github workflow**, Waffle).  We deployed the project with [Heroku](http://housematey.herokuapp.com/) | **Ruby** model of takeaway tested using RSpec with an emphasis on **SOLID** principles | **Apple swift 2.1** app using the RestCallApi |

### Skills
I am able to built and end to end application, using different technologies and adhering to the SOLID principles. I belive in TDD (Test Driven Development) and BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) and use red-green-refactor to code my projects.

#### Ruby and Ruby on Rails

 Ruby has been my first Ojbect Oriented Programming code language. Through It I learnt the Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion principles (SOLID) and Test-Driven
Development (TDD).

-  [Aiport](https://github.com/Mattia46/airport_challenge): A Program that can land and take-off planes from different airports as long as there is space and it isn't stormy. It is 100% tested using RSpec.

- [Oystercard](https://github.com/Mattia46/oystercard): This program reproduce the London Oystercard. As a user you can create your own oystercard, top It up, make journeys through different stations and being fined if you do not touch out at the end of your journey. Fully tested with RSpec.
-  [Yelp-clone](https://github.com/Mattia46/Yelp) In this project I made a Yelp clone with ruby on rails. I tested with RSpec and Capybara, Poltergeist and PhantomJS. For the backend I used a relational DataBase (Postgresql)


#### Javascript and MEAN stack including Angular and NodeJS
Javascript was the second language that I learned. I first learned and used JQuery as a frontend and MEAN stack, mongodb, express and NodeJS for the backend. I used Jasmine, Protractor and Frisby to test the code. I then learned AngularJS.

- [Not by Plane](https://github.com/Mattia46/not-by-plane) - An application intended to compare flight pricing and travel information with alternate modes of transport.
- Group project built in 3 days as a proof of concept.
- Angular utilised for the frontend.
- Integrated with the [Amadeus low fare seach API](https://sandbox.amadeus.com/api-catalog).

#### Javascript/AngularJS/jQuery

-  [Github user search](https://github.com/Mattia46/githubChallengeJS) A project to introduce me to the core concepts of AngularJS. Tested with Jasmine, Karma and PhantomJS
- [Thermostat](https://github.com/Mattia46/thermostatJs) A project to introduce
  me to the core concepts of jQuery. Tested with Jasmine .



#### Apple Swift (2.1)

-  [HouseMates iOs](https://github.com/Mattia46/Swift-houseMates) This iOS app
completes the MEAN stack project above. The main challenges that we faced were to
learn a new language in a single week given a lack of resources for the latest version of Swift (2.1), as well as having to create our own API to facilitate the communication for both web site and iOS.
