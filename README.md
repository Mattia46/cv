 
## MATTIA ASSOGNA

   Junior Web Developer available immediately.
   
   After many years in the tax legislation industry as a Corporate Tax Consultant, I realised
   that it was time to follow my passion, so I attended an intensive coding programme (Makers Academy in London)
   and graduated as a full-stack developer.
   Seeking a role with a focus on TDD/BDD, continued learning and innovation.

### Code Examples
| [HouseMates](https://github.com/Mattia46/HouseMates-Web) | [TakeAway](https://github.com/Mattia46/takeaway-challenge) | [Weather](https://github.com/Mattia46/SwiftWeatherApp) |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **MEAN stack/Swift** with [@Alaan](https://github.com/Alaanzr), [@Ezzy](https://github.com/ezzye) and [@Julien](https://github.com/jbhdeconinck).  In two weeks we built our own **API** using a combination of **Node**, **Express**, **Passport** and **Mongoose** to model the data. We also integrated the **Google Maps API**. I really enjoyed working in a team (using **github workflow**, Waffle).  We deployed the project with [Heroku](http://housematey.herokuapp.com/) | **Ruby** model of takeaway tested using RSpec with an emphasis on **SOLID** principles | **Apple swift 2.1** app using the RestCallApi |

## Skills

I am able to built and end to end application, using different technologies and adhering to the SOLID principles. I belive in TDD (Test Driven Development) and BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) and use red-green-refactor to code my projects.

#### Ruby and Ruby on Rails

 Ruby has been my first Ojbect Oriented Programming code language. Through It I learnt the Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion principles (SOLID), Test-Driven
Development (TDD) and Relational Database.

-  [Aiport](https://github.com/Mattia46/airport_challenge): A Program that can land and take-off planes from different airports as long as there is space and it isn't stormy. It is 100% tested using RSpec.

- [Oystercard](https://github.com/Mattia46/oystercard): This program reproduce the London Oystercard. As a user you can create your own oystercard, top It up, make journeys through different stations and being fined if you do not touch out at the end of your journey. Fully tested with RSpec.
-  [Yelp-clone](https://github.com/Mattia46/Yelp) In this project I made a Yelp clone with ruby on rails. I tested with RSpec and Capybara, Poltergeist and PhantomJS. For the backend I used a relational DataBase (Postgresql)


#### Javascript and MEAN stack including Angular and NodeJS
Javascript was the second language that I learned. I first learned and used JQuery as a frontend and MEAN stack, mongodb, express and NodeJS for the backend. I then learned AngularJS. I used Jasmine, Protractor and Frisby to test the code.

- [Not by Plane](https://github.com/Mattia46/not-by-plane) - An application intended to compare flight pricing and travel information with alternate modes of transport.
- Group project built in 3 days as a proof of concept.
- Angular utilised for the frontend.
- Integrated with the [Amadeus low fare seach API](https://sandbox.amadeus.com/api-catalog).

#### Javascript/AngularJS/jQuery

-  [Github user search](https://github.com/Mattia46/githubChallengeJS) A project to introduce me to the core concepts of AngularJS. Tested with Jasmine, Karma and PhantomJS
- [Thermostat](https://github.com/Mattia46/thermostatJs) A project to introduce
  me to the core concepts of jQuery. Tested with Jasmine .



#### Apple Swift (2.1)

I used this language for several small projects as well as for my final project [Housemate iOS](https://github.com/Mattia46/Swift-houseMates). The main challenge that I faced was to learn a new language given a lack of resources for the latest version of Swift (2.1), as well as having to create my own API to facilitate the communication between the web site and iOS application.

 - [Housemate iOS](https://github.com/Mattia46/Swift-houseMates) A web and iOS application that would help to avoid bed housemates through building up your own renting history and find people with your needs. The main challenge that I faced was to create an API to facilitate the communication between the web site and iOS application.
 
 - [Weather App](https://github.com/Mattia46/SwiftWeatherApp) An application to retrive information about the weather. I learnt how to make RespApiCall and manipulate the Json object.
 
 - [Twitter-clone](https://github.com/Mattia46/Swift_Twitter) An application who reproduce the Twitter App. I learnt how to login and sign up as well as how to post data into Firebase framework.
