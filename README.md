  # MATTIA ASSOGNA
  
   I recently became a Junior Web Developer and it quickly took over my life.
   After many years in the tax legislation industry as a Corporate Tax Consultant, I realised
   that it was time to follow my passion, so I attended an intensive coding programme (Makers Academy in London)Â·
   and I graduated as a full-stack developer.
   I am now looking to start my new career as a Junior Web Developer.
