 
## MATTIA ASSOGNA

   Junior Web Developer available immediately.
   
   After many years in the tax legislation industry as a Corporate Tax Consultant, I realised
   that it was time to follow my passion, so I attended an intensive coding programme (Makers Academy in London)
   and graduated as a full-stack developer. I believe in TDD (Test Driven Development) and BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) and use red-green-refactor to code my projects.
  
  My last three projects:
 - Housemate (website and native iOS app), find new housemate, TDD, MEAN Stack and iOS app Apple Swift (2.1)
 - Takeaway (website), BDD, MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS) and JQuery.
 - Not by Plane (website), find the best transportation between Airplain and Train. Retrieve and manipulate JSON object from Amadeus API using MEAN stack

Seeking a role with a focus on TDD/BDD, continued learning and innovation.


## Skills

I am able to built and end to end application, using different technologies and adhering to the SOLID principles. 

#### Ruby and Ruby on Rails

 Ruby was my first Ojbect Oriented Programming code language. Through It I learnt the Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion principles (SOLID), Test-Driven
Development (TDD) and Relational Database.

- [Takeaway](https://github.com/Mattia46/takeaway-challenge): A Program that can manage a takeaway order. I learnt how to implement Twillio API. It is 100% tested using RSpec.

- [Oystercard](https://github.com/Mattia46/oystercard): This program reproduce the London Oystercard. As a user you can create your own oystercard, top It up, make journeys through different stations and being fined if you do not touch out at the end of your journey. Fully tested with RSpec.

- [Yelp-clone](https://github.com/Mattia46/Yelp) In this project I made a Yelp clone with ruby on rails. I tested with **RSpec** and **Capybara**, **Poltergeist** and **PhantomJS**. For the backend I used a relational DataBase (**Postgresql**)


#### Javascript and MEAN stack including Angular and NodeJS
Javascript was the second language that I learned. I first learned and used JQuery as a frontend and MEAN stack, mongodb, express and NodeJS for the backend. I then learned AngularJS. I used Jasmine, Protractor and Frisby to test the code.

- [HouseMates](https://github.com/Mattia46/HouseMates-Web) A web and iOS application to relieve the stress of finding new housemates. I learnt how to create an **API** using a combination of **Node**, **Express**, **Passport** and **Mongoose** to model the data. I also integrated the **Google Maps API**. For frontend I used **Angular**, **Html** and **Css**. I really enjoyed working in a team (using github workflow, Waffle).  I deployed the project with [Heroku](http://housematey.herokuapp.com/)

- [Not by Plane](https://github.com/Mattia46/not-by-plane) Group project built in 3 days as a proof of concept. An application intended to compare flight pricing and travel information with alternate modes of transport. I learnt how to retrieve and manipulate *AJAX object* from an API. I used AngularJS as a frontend and [Amadeus low fare seach API](https://sandbox.amadeus.com/api-catalog).

- [TakeAway](https://github.com/Mattia46/takeaway_project) Group project built in 4 days. I learnt how to work in a team using Githun workflow and Waffle. I also use **Twillio**. The application is tested with Jasmine.

-  [Github user search](https://github.com/Mattia46/githubChallengeJS) A project to introduce me to the core concepts of AngularJS. Tested with Jasmine, Karma and PhantomJS


#### Apple Swift (2.1)

I used this language for several small projects as well as for my final project [Housemate iOS](https://github.com/Mattia46/Swift-houseMates). The main challenge that I faced was to learn a new language given a lack of resources for the latest version of Swift (2.1).

 - [Housemate iOS](https://github.com/Mattia46/Swift-houseMates) A web and iOS application to relieve the stress of finding new housemates. The App let you to create your own renting history, find people with your needs and connect with them. The main challenge that I faced was to create an API to facilitate the communication between the web site and iOS application.
 
 - [Weather App](https://github.com/Mattia46/SwiftWeatherApp) An application to retreive information about the weather. I learnt how to make RespApiCall and manipulate the Json object.
 
 - [Twitter-clone](https://github.com/Mattia46/Swift_Twitter) An application who reproduce the Twitter App. I learnt how to login and sign up as well as how to post data into Firebase framework.
