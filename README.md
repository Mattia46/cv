 
## MATTIA ASSOGNA

   I recently became a Junior Web Developer and it quickly took over my life.
   After many years in the tax legislation industry as a Corporate Tax Consultant, I realised
   that it was time to follow my passion, so I attended an intensive coding programme (Makers Academy in London)
   and graduated as a full-stack developer.
   I am now looking to start my new career as a Junior Web Developer.

### Code Examples
| [HouseMates](https://github.com/Mattia46/HouseMates-Web) | [TakeAway](https://github.com/Mattia46/takeaway-challenge) | [Weather](https://github.com/Mattia46/SwiftWeatherApp) |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **MEAN stack/Swift** with [@Alaan](https://github.com/Alaanzr), [@Ezzy](https://github.com/ezzye) and [@Julien](https://github.com/jbhdeconinck).  We built our own **API** using a combination of **Node**, **Express**, **Passport** and **Mongoose** to model the data. We also integrated the **Google Maps API**. I really enjoyed working in a team (using **github workflow**, Waffle).  We deployed the project with [Heroku](http://housematey.herokuapp.com/) | **Ruby** model of takeaway tested using RSpec with an emphasis on **SOLID** principles | **Apple swift 2.1** app using the RestCallApi |
   ### Skill
I am able to built and end to end application, using different technologies and adhering to the SOLID principles, AGILE proceses and TDD.


 **MEAN stack**

- [Not by Plane](https://github.com/Mattia46/not-by-plane) - An application intended to compare flight pricing and travel information with alternate modes of transport.
- Group project built in 3 days as a proof of concept.
- Angular utilised for the frontend.
- Integrated with the [Amadeus low fare seach API](https://sandbox.amadeus.com/api-catalog).

 **Javascript/AngularJS/jQuery**

-  [Github user search](https://github.com/Mattia46/githubChallengeJS) A project to introduce me to the core concepts of AngularJS. Tested with Jasmine, Karma and PhantomJS
- [Thermostat](https://github.com/Mattia46/thermostatJs) A project to introduce
  me to the core concepts of jQuery. Tested with Jasmine .


 **Ruby**

-  [Aiport](https://github.com/Mattia46/airport_challenge) &
[Oystercard](https://github.com/Mattia46/oystercard): I made these projects
following the Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface
segregation and Dependency inversion principles (SOLID) and Test-Driven
Development (TDD).
-  [Yelp-clone](https://github.com/Mattia46/Yelp) In this project I made a Yelp clone with **ruby on rails**. I tested with RSpec and Capybara, Poltergeist and PhantomJS. For the backend I
used a relational DataBase (Postgresql)

 **Apple Swift 2.1**

-  [HouseMates iOs](https://github.com/Mattia46/Swift-houseMates) This iOS app
completes the MEAN stack project above. The main challenges that we faced were to
learn a new language in a single week given a lack of resources for the latest version of Swift (2.1), as well as having to create our own API to facilitate the communication for both web site and iOS.
